  PC NAVTEX
 
/*******************************************/


The program PC NAVTEX is based on Qt.

Compiling:

sudo apt install qt5-default libqt5serialport5-dev qt4-linguist-tools
git clone https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/pc-navtex
cd pc-navtex/pc-navtex
QT_SELECT=5 qmake
make


You can place the udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d. 
With this udev rule, the serial port of your PC NAVTEX USB 
device will be seen as /dev/navtex, independ of you have further 
serial devices conected.

If not working, check vendor and produckt Id. The delivered serial-to-usb 
adapter may change over the years. To see your vendeor / product Id, 
plug the device and check the output of dmesg.

The program works without the udev rule too. The cavit is the device 
name of your PC NAVTEX USB may change if you plug any other serial device, 
like GPS.
