  PC NAVTEX
 
/*******************************************/


The program PC NAVTEX works together with 
the NAVTEX receiver "PC NAVTEX USB" from NASA.

You can download, read and store messages received by 
this device.

PC NAVTEX ist tested under Linux systems, on PC 
and on Raspberry Pi 3B+. 

Other platforms possible too. The program is written 
using the Qt framework. There no platform specific 
features used. So, a port to Windows should be able 
without any changes.
